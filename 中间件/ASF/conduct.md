### CODE OF CONDUCT

### INTRODUCTION

This code of conduct applies to all spaces the Apache Software Foundation manages, including IRC, public and private mailing lists, issue, wikis, blogs, Twitter, and any other communication channels our communities use. A code of conduct which is specific to in-persion events (ie., conferences) is in the ASF anti-harassment policy.

We expect everyone who participates in the Apache community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the Foundation, in any Foundation-related activities and especially when representing the ASF in any role to honor this code of conduct.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It distills our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect all members of the Apache community to follow it in spirit as much as in the letter, so that it can enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.
